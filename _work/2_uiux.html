        <h2>Yet another expense tracker...</h2>
        <p>Despite all of the brilliant offerings on the market, I was intrigued by how most of the teen demographic in the country didn't use any of them. In this project, I set out to find the reasons why...and hopefully fix them if I could.</p>

        <p>A conversation is much easier to follow along than a spreadsheet. What if, instead of terms like: income, expenses, debt, etc...we simply opt for the user to fill out the sentence: "I spent _____ at _____ on _____". This would help take a heavy cognitive burden on the user while still gathering all the required inputs...</p>
