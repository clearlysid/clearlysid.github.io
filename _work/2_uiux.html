description: Despite access to so many expense-tracking platforms, I was intrigued by how most teens in the country didn't use any of them. In this project, I set out to find the reasons why  ...and hopefully fix them if I could.<br><br>"Simply Spent" is an app concept, aimed at providing a frictionless experience tracking day to day transactions for young adults in India.

        <h2 class="lax" data-lax-preset_large="eager-20">User Research</h2>
        <p>I surveyed about 120 College and High-School students and conducted 6 in-person interviews to further understand what barrier existed between their expenses and their tech.</p>

        <h2 class="lax" data-lax-preset_large="eager-50">Insights</h2>
        <p class="lax" data-lax-preset_large="eager-30">The primary pain point reported by most of the students was the sheer amount of effort it took to input a single transaction into their tracker. It was boring, unneccesarily time consuming and more often than not, people would just forget to do it.</p>
        <p class="lax">There were some overlap of these answers and there were also some people who said they do track their finance but aren't content with the way they currently do it.</p>

        <h2 class="lax" data-lax-preset_large="eager-50">User Persona</h2>
        <p class="lax" data-lax-preset_large="eager-30">Rajeev is a 20 year old BBA fresher. He has just started to realize the importance of personal finance as he now has to manage expenses himself. He also wants to buy a motorbike.</p>
        <p>To ensure I didn't get sidetracked, I kept my goals simple: Create an app that would help Rajeev<ul style="padding-left: 1rem; opacity: 0.7;">
            <li>Track his spending</li>
            <li>Set, and stick to, a Budget</li>
            <li>Improve his financial literacy (secondary)</li>
        </ul></p>

        <h2 class="lax" data-lax-preset_large="eager-20">Solution</h2>
        <p>A conversation is much easier to follow along than a spreadsheet. What if, instead of terms like: income, expenses, debt, etc...we simply opt for the user to fill out the sentence: "I spent _____ at _____ on _____". This would help take a heavy cognitive burden on the user while still gathering all the required inputs...</p>
