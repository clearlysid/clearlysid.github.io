Assignment Brief
-----------------
{: .text-left}
Our objective was to derive a design project based on any one of the five classical elements: Fire, Air, Water, Earth or Aether, and execute it. I eventually settled on the element Air, and started studying how its composition had changes over the years.

Research
----------
{: .text-right}
Reading through several papers on the topic, I came across the International EMF Project, which has been established by WHO as a platform to provide a coordinated international response to concerns about possible health effects on exposure to Electromagnetic Radiation.

Arriving at the Problem
---------------------
{: .text-center}
The homepage of the project at https://who.int/emf doesn't make it clear what the project is, at first glance. In fact, for first-time visitors to the project page, there isn't any context provided at all. This gave me the basis of my project.

Conceptualization
-----------------
{: .text-right}
Through a short motion infographic, I wanted to create an “elevator pitch” for the project. Something that communicated to site visitors what the project was all about. I decided to condense my pitch to no more than 90 seconds and started working on the script. An authoritative, but neutral tone of voice was needed for a serious topic like this.

Ideation
----------------
{: .text-left}
Scene by scene, I sketched out how the script will play out and described the visuals. Visualizing different ways of presenting information and working out the transitions. My main goal was to explore how information could be conveyed by basic geometric shapes and typography using motion.

Visual Style
----------------
{: .text-right}
Once I was happy with my script and storyboarding, I starting to think about the colours, typography and other visual elements I would use in the project. I created a few of my scenes in Adobe I  llustrator and focused on styling them as they would appear in the final product.
