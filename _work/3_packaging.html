        <h2 class="lax" data-lax-preset="eager-25">The Brief</h2>
        <p>This was quick project aimed at teaching us the basics of packaging design by walking us through the entire design process from start to finish via a Design Sprint condensed down to a single day.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="lax" data-lax-preset="lazy-20">Other than the time limit, we were challenged to work within the parameters given in the brief. This included the product selection, form of the packaging, target personas and even the choice of fonts and colours</p>

        <h2 class="lax" data-lax-preset="eager-25">Product + Target Group</h2>
        <p>I opted for Popcorn as my product. To make things even interesting I picked Neelima, the Paediatrician, as my target persona. This gave me a very different perspective from which to approach the research phase.</p>
