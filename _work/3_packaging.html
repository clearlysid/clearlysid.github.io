        <h2 class="lax" data-lax-preset="eager-20">The Challenge</h2>
        <p >Other than the time limit, we were challenged to work within the parameters given in the brief. This included the product selection, form of the packaging, target personas and even the choice of fonts and colours</p><br><br>

        <h2>Product + Target Group</h2>
        <p class="lax" data-lax-preset="lazy-20">I opted for Popcorn as my product. To make things even interesting I picked Neelima, the Paediatrician, as my target persona. This gave me a very different perspective from which to approach the research phase.</p>

        <p>Neelima loves kids and often has them over in her office. As Popcorn Planet makes some of the most delicious and healthy popcorn, she always keeps a few small, handy packets there to give them.</p>
