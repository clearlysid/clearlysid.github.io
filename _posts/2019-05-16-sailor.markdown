permalink:

As the emphasis in product development continues to shift from form development to user experience (UX) and other elements of human to computer interaction, industrial designers need to adapt in order to thrive in an increasingly digital environment.

What better proof than the growing difference in hourly rates between interaction designers and industrial designers? The former are commanding nice premiums over their counterparts, and large design consultancies are reorganizing, their focus shifting from industrial design to user interface and user experience design.

My advice to the industrial designers I work with at Bresslergroup: Don’t despair. Adapt!

As an industrial designer who has been in this business for more than 20 years, I’ve spent a lot of time reflecting on this, especially as it relates to Bresslergroup, the research-driven product development firm where I am currently Director of Design. Here’s the advice I give my industrial design team:

1. Embrace Interaction Design 
A future in which industrial design reports to user experience and interaction designers is not far off. Some forward-thinking, tech-driven companies have already adopted this structure. At Bresslergroup, we’re growing our interaction design team, but at the same time we want to bolster our industrial designers’ understanding of interaction design.

We believe our industrial designers will be better off once they hybridize — that is, combine their industrial design expertise with central tenets of user experience and interaction design.

Interaction design is multifaceted, allowing industrial designers to focus on existing strengths. Those who are stronger at product usability, architecture, and ergonomics may find themselves better suited to the usability and information architecture aspects of interaction design. Industrial designers who find themselves drawn to visual brand language and form development may find a more natural fit in the visual design aspects of interaction design.

2. Hone Your Front-End Research Expertise

While you no longer need an industrial design degree to design and manufacture a product — thanks in part to 3D printing — there’s still a need for well-trained designers who can develop strategy to inform product experiences. As design and manufacturing become more commoditized, innovation strategy expertise will be more valued than implementation.

When anyone and everyone can manufacture a product, the need to communicate something specific and profound will become more important than ever. Designers who can develop strong brand identities and product experiences will stand out amongst the crowd and help products cut through the noise.

This opens up an opportunity for industrial designers to thrive by honing their front-end research and brand strategy capabilities, skills long associated with our discipline. As the general public develops an immunity to traditional forms of advertising and marketing, these skills will help industrial designers contribute to products that don’t simply function but have emotional appeal and provide a holistic product experience.

Brand-focused strategic designers who use form and aesthetics to create something unique will rise to the top.
